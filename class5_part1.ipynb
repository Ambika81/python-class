    "# Functions\n",
    "#A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.\n",
    "# Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n",
    "##As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. \n",
    "#These functions are called user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).\n",
    "#Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "# The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.\n",
    "# By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.\n",

    "#Keyword arguments\n",
    "#Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.\n",
    "##This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because the Python interpreter is able to use the keywords provided to match the values with parameters. You can also make keyword calls to the printme() function in the following ways −\n",
